# Vercel AI SDK v5 · Grok Step 1 Implementation Notes

These notes summarize the key takeaways from the AI SDK v5 launch stream and document how the guidance is now reflected in our Grok Step 1 workflow.

## Provider setup and service layer

- **Dedicated provider factory**: We initialize the xAI provider once in `lib/ai/architectAI.ts` with `createXai({ apiKey: process.env.XAI_API_KEY })`. This keeps the API key surface area tiny and avoids re-instantiating the client inside workflow steps.
- **Service-focused wrapper**: `generateGrokItineraryDraft` encapsulates the entire Grok call—prompt dispatch, latency tracking, error handling, and JSON extraction. Workflows call this helper instead of juggling raw SDK calls.
- **Prompt composition helper**: `buildGrokItineraryPrompt` mirrors the video’s advice to keep prompt assembly alongside the service so the workflow stays thin and declarative.

## Response hygiene and fallbacks

- The service normalizes the AI response and retries the content extraction against multiple candidates (primary text, parsed JSON `content`, tool arguments, Grok reasoning output) exactly as demonstrated in the stream.
- Metadata (`usage`, `finishReason`, `responseStatus`, fallback source, latency) is bubbled up so the workflow can log the same telemetry as before.
- Final itinerary JSON is trimmed out of any code fences before returning; parsing errors throw early with descriptive messages.

## Workflow integration (`inngest/functions/itinerary.ts`)

- Step 1 now focuses on orchestration: it logs prompt previews, invokes `generateGrokItineraryDraft`, records the returned metadata, and persists the cleaned JSON to Redis/vector storage.
- The legacy inline Grok logic and duplicated JSON parsing helpers were removed in favor of the shared service.
- All existing log IDs and shapes remain intact, preserving downstream observability and alerting contracts.

## Usage snapshot

1. Build the prompt inside the workflow with `buildGrokItineraryPrompt(formData)`.  
2. Call `await generateGrokItineraryDraft({ prompt, model: 'grok-4-fast-reasoning' })`.  
3. Inspect `draft.metadata` for telemetry, `draft.rawOutput` for the original LLM text, and `draft.cleanedJson`/`draft.itinerary` for downstream storage.

## Operational guardrails

- The service throws if `XAI_API_KEY` is missing, matching the best practice from the video to surface configuration issues immediately.
- Latency is measured inside the helper and surfaced to the workflow, enabling future SLO enforcement without duplicating timers.
- Response previews are truncated to 600 characters before logging to avoid jumbo console spam while still showing enough debug context.

With these changes, Step 1 adheres to the recommended AI SDK v5 architecture: thin workflows, thick service helpers, and clear observability hooks.
