## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-27
- Q: Which AI service should the system integrate with for itinerary generation? ‚Üí A: xAI Grok via Groq using AI SDK Vercel
- Q: Which mapping service should be used for destination map images? ‚Üí A: Google Maps Static API (using SERP API key)
- Q: What should be the maximum processing time allowed for AI itinerary generation before timeout? ‚Üí A: Addressed by using Inngest (workflow kit), Upstash Redis
- Q: How should the PDF export and email sharing functionality be implemented? ‚Üí A: Client-side PDF generation with jsPDF (html2canvas for DOM capture) plus a browser email client handoff
- Q: What data sources should be used to provide up-to-date travel information for AI itinerary generation? ‚Üí A: Real-time web scraping (using Groq compound, Tavily, Exa to search the web) & API integrations (tourism boards, booking sites, review sites)

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a traveler who has completed the trip planning forms, I want to generate a personalized AI-created itinerary so that I can see a comprehensive, structured travel plan that incorporates all my preferences, budget, dates, and travel group details in a visually organized format.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has completed all required trip forms (location, dates, travelers, budget, preferences), **When** they click the "Generate Itinerary" button, **Then** the system displays a personalized itinerary with header, trip summary, key details, map, daily activities, travel tips, and action buttons AND logs 24 sequential console messages tracking the complete process flow.

2. **Given** a user has flexible dates selected, **When** the itinerary is generated, **Then** the date section shows "Day 1, Day 2..." format instead of specific calendar dates AND console logs show proper flexible date handling in steps 4 and 19.

3. **Given** a user has a flexible budget selected, **When** the itinerary is generated, **Then** the budget section displays "Budget is flexible" instead of specific amounts AND console logs show flexible budget processing in steps 6 and 19.

4. **Given** a completed itinerary is displayed, **When** the user clicks action buttons, **Then** they can modify the itinerary, export as PDF, or email the itinerary AND console shows button interaction logging.

5. **Given** the itinerary generation process is initiated, **When** each processing step occurs, **Then** console displays detailed logs with format "Step [N]: [Action] in [filename] - [functionName]" including timestamp and relevant data objects.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when required form data is missing or incomplete? (Console should log validation failures in steps 3-9)
- How does the system handle locations with limited travel information? (Console should log AI service limitations in steps 11-12)
- What occurs if the AI service is unavailable or returns an error? (Console should log service failures and fallback procedures)
- How are very long trip nicknames or location names displayed in the layout? (Console should log truncation or formatting decisions in step 18-19)
- What if console logging itself fails or is disabled? (System should continue functioning without breaking)
- How does the system handle slow AI responses that may timeout? (Handled by Inngest workflow orchestration with Upstash Redis for reliable async processing)
