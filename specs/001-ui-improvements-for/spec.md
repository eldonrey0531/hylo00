# Feature Specification: UI Improvements for Travel Form Components

**Feature Branch**: `001-ui-improvements-for`  
**Created**: September 19, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "UI improvements for travelers count display with centered text and thick border, preference modals background fill without borders, and cleanup of duplicate preference files"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Identified: travelers count display, preference modals styling, file cleanup
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Actors: users interacting with travel form
   ‚Üí Actions: viewing traveler count, using preference modals
   ‚Üí Data: traveler count numbers, preference selections
   ‚Üí Constraints: visual consistency, usability
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All requirements are clearly specified in the user request
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí User flow: filling out travel form, viewing traveler count, using preferences
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement is testable and measurable
6. Identify Key Entities
   ‚Üí UI components, styling properties, file structure
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí No implementation details included
   ‚Üí All requirements are user-focused
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a user filling out the travel planning form, I want the "total travelers" count to be clearly displayed with centered text and a prominent border so that I can easily see and verify the number of people in my travel party. I also want the preference modals to have clean, full-width backgrounds without distracting borders so I can focus on selecting my preferences without visual clutter.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is on the travelers form section, **When** they adjust the adult or children count, **Then** the total travelers count displays as "Total travelers: X" with centered text and a thick, prominent border
2. **Given** a user opens any preference modal (accommodation, rental car, etc.), **When** the modal appears, **Then** the background color fills the entire row without any borders creating visual interruptions
3. **Given** the codebase contains duplicate preference files, **When** the cleanup is completed, **Then** only the correctly placed preference files remain in the appropriate directory structure

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the traveler count changes dynamically (should update display immediately)?
- How does the centered text display behave with different screen sizes?
- How do preference modals maintain usability without borders for visual separation?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display total travelers count in the format "Total travelers: X" where X is the sum of adults and children
- **FR-002**: Total travelers display MUST center the text within its container for visual balance
- **FR-003**: Total travelers display MUST have a thick, prominent border that makes the count clearly visible and distinguishable
- **FR-004**: Preference modals MUST have background colors that fill the entire row width without any border interruptions
- **FR-005**: System MUST remove duplicate AccommodationPreferences.tsx files, keeping only the correctly placed version
- **FR-006**: System MUST remove duplicate RentalCarPreferences.tsx files, keeping only the correctly placed version
- **FR-007**: Total travelers count MUST update immediately when adult or children counts change
- **FR-008**: Preference modal backgrounds MUST maintain visual cohesion while being border-free
- **FR-009**: All UI changes MUST preserve existing functionality and user interactions
- **FR-010**: Visual improvements MUST be consistent with the existing design system and color scheme

### Key Entities
- **Total Travelers Display**: Visual component showing the sum of travelers with centered text and thick border styling
- **Preference Modals**: Interactive dialogs for accommodation and rental car preferences with full-width backgrounds
- **Duplicate Files**: Incorrectly placed AccommodationPreferences.tsx and RentalCarPreferences.tsx files that need removal
- **Travel Form**: Parent container housing the travelers section and preference modals
