**Feature**: 003-group-travel-style  
**Estimated Time**: 15 minutes  
**Prerequisites**: Completed implementation following tasks.md

## Quick Validation Steps

### 1. Basic Feature Functionality (5 minutes)

**Test the Choice System**:
1. Open application in browser
2. Navigate through trip details form to travel style section
3. Verify you see:
   - "üåè TRAVEL STYLE" header (preserved)
   - Description text about optional questions (preserved)
   - Two choice buttons styled like GenerateItineraryButton

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ Choice buttons display with gradient background and white buttons

**Test Choice Selection**:
1. Click "I want to add answer more forms to suit my travel style"
2. Verify all detailed forms appear:
   - Travel Experience
   - Trip Vibe  
   - Sample Days
   - Dinner Choice
   - Trip Nickname
   - Generate Button

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ All detailed forms render exactly as before

**Test Skip Path**:
1. Refresh page and navigate back to travel style section
2. Click "Skip ahead"
3. Verify only nickname form and generate button appear

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ Only nickname form displays, no detailed preference forms

### 2. Form Functionality Validation (5 minutes)

**Test Detailed Path Forms**:
1. Choose detailed path
2. Fill out Travel Experience form
3. Fill out Trip Vibe form  
4. Fill out Sample Days form
5. Fill out Dinner Choice form
6. Enter trip nickname
7. Click Generate button

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ All forms work identically to previous implementation

**Test Skip Path Generation**:
1. Refresh and choose skip path
2. Enter trip nickname only
3. Click Generate button

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ Itinerary generation works with minimal data

### 3. Styling and UX Validation (3 minutes)

**Test Button Styling Consistency**:
1. Compare choice buttons to GenerateItineraryButton
2. Verify matching:
   - Gradient background container
   - White button with border
   - Font family (Raleway) and weight (bold)
   - Hover effects and transitions
   - Icon placement and sizing

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ Choice buttons visually match GenerateItineraryButton template

**Test Responsive Design**:
1. Test on mobile viewport (375px width)
2. Test on tablet viewport (768px width)  
3. Test on desktop viewport (1200px width)

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ Choice buttons and forms display correctly on all screen sizes

### 4. Data Persistence Validation (2 minutes)

**Test Session Persistence**:
1. Choose detailed path
2. Fill out first two forms
3. Note: choice should persist (no way to go back to choice in this session)
4. Complete remaining forms and generate

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ Choice persists through session, forms complete successfully

**Test Form Data Preservation**:
1. Choose detailed path
2. Fill out forms partially
3. Complete trip nickname and generate

**Expected Result**: ‚úÖ All partial form data preserved and included in generation

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Choice Buttons Not Displaying
**Check**: TravelStyleChoice component import in App.tsx
**Fix**: Verify import path: `import TravelStyleChoice from './TravelStyleChoice'`

### Styling Doesn't Match
**Check**: Tailwind classes match GenerateItineraryButton pattern
**Fix**: Copy exact classes from GenerateItineraryButton component

### Forms Not Appearing
**Check**: Conditional rendering logic in ConditionalTravelStyle component
**Fix**: Verify choice state management: `choice === TravelStyleChoice.DETAILED`

### Generate Button Missing
**Check**: Generate button placement in both choice paths
**Fix**: Ensure GenerateItineraryButton included in both DETAILED and SKIP paths

### Form Data Not Preserved
**Check**: Props passing to existing form components
**Fix**: Verify all existing props passed through unchanged
