# Feature Specification: Group Travel Style Section with Conditional Display

**Feature Branch**: `003-group-travel-style`  
**Created**: September 19, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Group travel style section starting from 'üåè TRAVEL STYLE' text through all preference forms up to 'generate my personalized itinerary'. Add two buttons at bottom: 'I want to add answer more forms to suit my travel style' (shows full travel style section) and 'Skip ahead' (shows only nickname form + generate button). This provides conditional display for travel style preferences based on user choice."

   ‚Üí UI behavior well-defined for both paths
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí Primary flow: User chooses detailed forms or skip option
5. Generate Functional Requirements

- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A user has completed the trip details form and encounters the travel style section. Instead of being required to fill out all travel style preference forms, they are presented with a choice: either complete detailed preference forms for a more personalized itinerary, or skip ahead to just provide their trip nickname and generate their itinerary immediately.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** user has completed trip details, **When** they reach the travel style section, **Then** they see the "üåè TRAVEL STYLE" header and description followed by two choice buttons at the bottom
2. **Given** user clicks "I want to add answer more forms to suit my travel style", **When** the choice is made, **Then** all travel style preference forms (Travel Experience, Trip Vibe, Sample Days, Dinner Choice) are displayed in sequence followed by the Trip Nickname form and Generate button
3. **Given** user clicks "Skip ahead", **When** the choice is made, **Then** only the Trip Nickname form is displayed followed by the Generate button
4. **Given** user has made either choice, **When** they complete their selected path, **Then** they can successfully generate their personalized itinerary
5. **Given** user is in detailed mode, **When** they complete all forms, **Then** the Generate button becomes available with their comprehensive preferences
6. **Given** user is in skip mode, **When** they provide their trip nickname, **Then** the Generate button becomes available with their basic trip details

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user navigates back after making a choice?
- How does system handle partial completion in detailed mode?
- What occurs if user refreshes page during form completion?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST group all travel style content (header, description, preference forms) into a cohesive section
- **FR-002**: System MUST display travel style section starting with "üåè TRAVEL STYLE" header and descriptive text about optional questions
- **FR-003**: System MUST present two choice buttons at the bottom of the initial travel style section
- **FR-004**: Button one MUST be labeled "I want to add answer more forms to suit my travel style" and reveal detailed preference forms when selected
- **FR-005**: Button two MUST be labeled "Skip ahead" and bypass detailed forms when selected
- **FR-006**: Detailed path MUST include all existing travel style forms: Travel Experience, Trip Vibe, Sample Days, and Dinner Choice
- **FR-007**: Skip path MUST show only the Trip Nickname form
- **FR-008**: Both paths MUST conclude with the Trip Nickname form and Generate My Personalized Itinerary button
- **FR-009**: System MUST preserve all existing form validation and data handling
- **FR-010**: User choice MUST be persistent during the current session
- **FR-011**: Generate button MUST function identically regardless of chosen path
- **FR-012**: System MUST maintain existing styling and visual design patterns

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **TravelStyleChoice**: Represents user's decision between detailed forms or skip ahead (enum: detailed, skip)
- **TravelStyleSection**: Contains all travel style content from header through choice buttons
- **FormPath**: Defines which forms are displayed based on user choice (detailed: all forms, skip: nickname only)
- **PreferenceData**: Optional travel style answers collected in detailed path, empty in skip path
