## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user planning a trip, I want the travel style section to have consistent visual styling throughout my interaction so that the interface feels polished and content remains clearly readable.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I'm viewing the travel style section, **When** I see the initial state, **Then** the section has a yellow background like other form sections for visual consistency and text readability
2. **Given** I click "I want to add answer more forms to suit my travel style", **When** the detailed forms appear, **Then** all form components maintain their proper background color (#ece8de) and the travel style section keeps its yellow background
3. **Given** I click "Skip ahead", **When** the nickname form appears, **Then** the form has the proper background color (#ece8de) and the travel style section keeps its yellow background
4. **Given** I haven't clicked either travel style button, **When** I scroll down, **Then** I should not see a duplicate "Generate my personalized itinerary" button before making my travel style choice

### Edge Cases
- What happens when switching between travel style choices? (Background styling should remain consistent)
- How does the page handle multiple rapid clicks on travel style buttons? (No duplicate buttons or styling conflicts)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Travel style section MUST have yellow background (#b0c29b) matching the trip details section styling for visual consistency
- **FR-002**: Travel style section MUST maintain yellow background when either choice button is clicked
- **FR-003**: All travel style form components MUST maintain their proper background color (#ece8de) when displayed after choice selection
- **FR-004**: System MUST NOT display duplicate "Generate my personalized itinerary" button before user makes travel style choice
- **FR-005**: Text content in travel style section MUST remain clearly readable with proper contrast against yellow background
- **FR-006**: Form styling MUST be consistent between detailed forms mode and skip-ahead mode
- **FR-007**: Visual styling changes MUST not affect existing functionality or form data handling

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Travel Style Section Container**: Main wrapper that needs consistent yellow background styling
- **Travel Style Choice Buttons**: Interactive elements that trigger form display
- **Travel Style Forms**: Individual form components that need proper #ece8de background
- **Generate Button**: Action button that should only appear once per section appropriately
