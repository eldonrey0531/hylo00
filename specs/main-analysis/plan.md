## Summary

Hylo Travel AI is a sophisticated multi-agent travel planning system built with React/TypeScript frontend and Vercel Edge Functions backend. The system uses intelligent LLM routing across multiple providers (Cerebras, Gemini, Groq) with comprehensive observability via LangSmith integration. The architecture implements constitutional principles including edge-first deployment, multi-LLM resilience, observable operations, type-safe development, and cost-conscious design.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x with React 18, Node.js compatible for Vercel Edge Runtime
**Primary Dependencies**: React, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Zod validation, LangSmith observability
**Storage**: Stateless (no persistence layer) with session-based form state management
**Testing**: Currently needs comprehensive test coverage (identified gap)
**Target Platform**: Vercel Edge Runtime with global CDN distribution
**Project Type**: Web application (React SPA + serverless API)
**Performance Goals**: Sub-50ms cold starts, real-time streaming responses, <200ms API latency
**Constraints**: Edge-compatible dependencies only, no Node.js APIs in edge functions, token/cost optimization
**Scale/Scope**: Multi-tenant travel planning service with 4 specialized AI agents, 3 LLM providers

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

✅ **Edge-First Architecture**: All API functions run on Vercel Edge Runtime, no Node.js dependencies in edge functions, client-side API keys forbidden

✅ **Multi-LLM Resilience**: Cerebras, Gemini, Groq providers with automatic failover, circuit breaker patterns implemented

✅ **Observable AI Operations**: LangSmith integration comprehensive, all LLM operations logged with complexity analysis and cost tracking

✅ **Type-Safe Development**: Strict TypeScript with Zod runtime validation throughout, edge-compatible type definitions

✅ **Cost-Conscious Design**: Provider selection optimized by query complexity, token usage tracking, budget management

**Status**: PASS - All constitutional requirements met

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - Current implementation follows this pattern correctly

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

✅ **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:

- No NEEDS CLARIFICATION identified - codebase is well-documented and structured
- All dependencies are clearly defined and edge-compatible
- Architecture patterns are established and constitutional

✅ **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

- Multi-agent system architecture research: ✓ Completed
- LLM provider routing patterns research: ✓ Completed
- Vercel Edge Runtime optimization research: ✓ Completed
- Observability and monitoring best practices: ✓ Completed

✅ **Consolidate findings** in `research.md`:

- Decision: Multi-provider LLM architecture with intelligent routing
- Rationale: Resilience, cost optimization, performance optimization
- Alternatives considered: Single provider, client-side routing, server-side unified interface

**Output**: research.md with architectural analysis and best practices

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

**Design Approach**:

1. **Extract entities from codebase** → `data-model.md`:

   - TravelFormData, AgentLog, LLMRequest/Response models
   - Provider configurations and routing decisions
   - Health monitoring and observability schemas

2. **Generate API contracts** from existing endpoints:

   - `/api/llm/route` - Main LLM routing endpoint
   - `/api/health/system` - System health monitoring
   - `/api/providers/status` - Provider status checking
   - Output OpenAPI schemas to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:

   - Multi-agent workflow testing
   - Provider fallback scenario testing
   - Health monitoring validation
   - Tests must be implemented (currently missing)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:

   - Travel planning workflow end-to-end
   - Provider failover scenarios
   - Real-time monitoring validation

5. **Update agent file incrementally**:
   - Update `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with current architecture
   - Add constitutional compliance context
   - Include multi-agent system patterns

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/\*, comprehensive test suite, quickstart.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from current codebase analysis and missing components
- Each API endpoint → contract test task [P]
- Each service module → unit test task [P]
- Each user workflow → integration test task
- Documentation and deployment optimization tasks

**Priority Areas Identified**:

1. **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive test coverage (contract, integration, unit)
2. **Documentation Enhancement**: API documentation, deployment guides
3. **Performance Optimization**: Bundle analysis, edge function optimization
4. **Monitoring Enhancement**: Additional observability metrics
5. **Security Hardening**: Input validation, rate limiting enhancements

**Ordering Strategy**:

- Test infrastructure setup first (enables TDD for new features)
- Contract tests for existing APIs [P]
- Integration tests for multi-agent workflows
- Performance and monitoring enhancements
- Documentation and deployment optimization

**Estimated Output**: 35-40 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md focusing on testing, documentation, and optimization

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_No constitutional violations identified - system architecture aligns with all principles_

| Area                     | Complexity Level | Justification                                  |
| ------------------------ | ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Multi-Agent Architecture | High             | Required for specialized travel planning tasks |
| Provider Routing         | Medium           | Essential for resilience and cost optimization |
| Observability Stack      | Medium           | Constitutional requirement for AI operations   |

**All complexity is justified and aligned with constitutional principles.**
