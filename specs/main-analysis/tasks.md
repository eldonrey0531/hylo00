# Tasks: RAG Multi-Agent Travel Planning System

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/main-analysis/`
**Prerequisites**: rag-plan.md (required), rag-research.md, rag-data-model.md, contracts/

## Execution Flow (main)

```
✓ 1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   → Loaded rag-plan.md: TypeScript/React web app with Vercel Edge Runtime
   → Tech stack: Qdrant, Supabase, Upstash, LangSmith, GROQ browser search
✓ 2. Load design documents:
   → rag-data-model.md: 15+ entities → model creation tasks
   → contracts/rag-api-spec.yaml: 6 endpoints → contract test tasks
   → rag-research.md: Architecture decisions → setup tasks
✓ 3. Generate tasks by category:
   → Setup: Infrastructure, dependencies, configurations
   → Tests: Contract tests, integration tests, unit tests
   → Core: Models, services, vector operations, session management
   → Integration: LLM providers, web search, observability
   → Polish: Performance optimization, documentation, deployment
✓ 4. Apply task rules:
   → Different files = [P] for parallel execution
   → Same file = sequential (no [P])
   → Tests before implementation (TDD approach)
✓ 5. Number tasks sequentially (T001-T048)
✓ 6. Generate dependency graph
✓ 7. Create parallel execution examples
✓ 8. Validate task completeness:
   → All 6 API endpoints have contract tests ✓
   → All 15+ entities have model definitions ✓
   → All integration points tested ✓
✓ 9. SUCCESS - 48 tasks ready for execution
```

## Dependencies

### Critical Path Dependencies

- **Infrastructure** (T001-T006) → **Contract Tests** (T007-T015) → **Core Implementation**
- **Data Models** (T016-T022) → **Services** (T023-T043) → **API Endpoints** (T044-T049)
- **Vector Service** (T023-T029) ← **Session Service** (T030-T037) → **RAG Service** (T038-T043)

### Specific Dependencies

- T023 (VectorService) blocks T038-T043 (RAG Service methods)
- T030 (SessionService) blocks T038-T043 (RAG Service methods)
- T007-T015 (Contract Tests) must complete before T044-T049 (API Endpoints)
- T016-T022 (Data Models) blocks all service implementations
- T055-T059 (Provider Integration) requires existing LLM routing service

### Parallel Execution Groups

```bash
# Group 1: Infrastructure Setup (parallel)
T003 & T004 & T005 & T006

# Group 2: Contract Tests (parallel - different files)

## Validation Checklist

_GATE: Checked before task execution_

- [x] All 6 RAG API endpoints have corresponding contract tests (T007-T012)
- [x] All 15+ data entities have model creation tasks (T016-T022)
- [x] All contract tests come before implementation (T007-T015 → T044-T049)
- [x] Parallel tasks operate on different files or independent components
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path and clear deliverable
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task
- [x] Critical dependencies clearly mapped (Vector ← Session → RAG Service)
- [x] Constitutional compliance maintained throughout all tasks
- [x] Observability integration mandatory for all LLM operations
- [x] Edge runtime compatibility verified for all new components

## Constitutional Compliance Verification

Each task must maintain constitutional principles:

### Edge-First Architecture

- All API functions (T044-T049) run on Vercel Edge Runtime
- Vector service (T023-T029) uses edge-compatible Qdrant client
- Session service (T030-T037) uses edge-compatible Supabase/Upstash clients

### Multi-LLM Resilience

- Provider routing (T055-T059) maintains 3-provider architecture
- Circuit breaker patterns (T059) prevent cascading failures
- Complexity-based routing (T056-T058) optimizes provider selection

### Observable AI Operations

- LangSmith integration (T060-T064) mandatory for all RAG operations
- Cost tracking (T063) per request and provider
- Performance monitoring (T061-T062) with real-time dashboards

### Type-Safe Development

- Zod validation (T016-T022) for all RAG schemas
- TypeScript strict mode for all implementations
- Edge-compatible type definitions throughout

### Cost-Conscious Design

- Budget tracking (T063) with limits and alerts
- Complexity-based provider selection (T056-T058)
- Vector query optimization (T070-T072) for efficiency

## Success Metrics

Upon completion of all tasks, the system should achieve:

### Functional Success

- Complete RAG pipeline from form submission to itinerary generation
- Session-aware context retrieval across user interactions
- Real-time web search integration with proper citations
- Follow-up Q&A capability with contextual responses

### Technical Success

- 90%+ test coverage across all RAG components
- Sub-500ms vector search performance
- <30s end-to-end itinerary generation
- Zero constitutional compliance violations

### Performance Success

- 100+ concurrent sessions supported
- <50ms cold start times maintained
- Automatic provider failover within 2s
- Cost tracking accuracy within 1% margin

This comprehensive task list provides a clear roadmap for implementing the RAG multi-agent system while maintaining the sophisticated architecture and constitutional principles of the Hylo Travel AI platform.
