**Input**: User description: "In Date Form Fields: departDate, returnDate - I cannot do the manual typing. and if they click in the white space inside the form the calendar should pop-up. In Budget Form - when dragging the range slider the indicator of or display won't follow the slider. For the preference modal for each inclusion the buttons can't be pressed or the fields can't be typed. On the "Accommodations preferences" section that pops up, if they select "Other", can we have a a text box that pops up with the prompt: Tell us more about your preferred preferences. On the "Rental car preferences" section that pops up, can we have the "Preferred vehicle type" be multi-select instead of single-select?. On the TRAVEL INTERESTS section, change "Select all that apply" to "Select all that apply to this trip". On the BUDGET section, can we add a toggle (similar to the one on the DATES section) that says: I'm not sure or my budget is flexible. If they toggle it on, it removes the rest of what's in this section, so it just says BUDGET and the toggle with "I'm not sure or my budget is flexible". How can we optimize TRAVEL STYLE questions more hidden/optional. I know we already say they are optional, but it still feels overwhelming when someone is filling it out. I thought we could do something like this with 2 buttons that have different options: button 1 will be saying to answer some of the travel style forms and button 2 will be skip ahead something words If they choose button **1**, the TRAVEL STYLE section appears with the 4 additional questions. If they choose **option 2**, the final section appears: the trip nickname form."**Input**: User description: "In Date Form Fields: departDate, returnDate - I cannot do the manual typing. and if they click in the white space inside the form the calendar should pop-up.
