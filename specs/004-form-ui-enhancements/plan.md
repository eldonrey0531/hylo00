# Implementation Plan: Form UI Enhancements

**Branch**: `004-form-ui-enhancements` | **Date**: September 18, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/004-form-ui-enhancements/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Primary requirement: Enhance travel form UI interactions including date picker accessibility, budget slider synchronization, preference modal functionality, travel interests labeling, flexible budget toggle, and travel style progressive disclosure.

Technical approach: Implement production-grade React component enhancements with TypeScript state management, maintaining constitutional compliance for edge-first architecture and observable operations.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+, React 18.2+  
**Primary Dependencies**: React Hook Form, Zod validation, TailwindCSS, Lucide React icons  
**Storage**: Local component state with React hooks, form persistence via sessionStorage  
**Testing**: Vitest for unit tests, Playwright for E2E form interactions  
**Target Platform**: Vercel Edge Runtime, modern browsers (Chrome 100+, Safari 15+, Firefox 100+)
**Project Type**: web - React frontend with Vercel Edge Functions backend  
**Performance Goals**: <100ms form interactions, <50ms state updates, 60fps animations  
**Constraints**: Edge-compatible code only, no Node.js APIs, <200KB component bundle size  
**Scale/Scope**: 5 form sections, 17 functional requirements, progressive enhancement patterns

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

**I. Edge-First Architecture**: ✅ PASS

- Form components run in browser, no server-side dependencies
- No Node.js APIs required for form interactions
- Client-side validation and state management only

**II. Multi-LLM Resilience**: ✅ PASS

- Form enhancements are independent of LLM operations
- No impact on existing provider routing or fallback chains
- UI improvements support continued operation during LLM outages

**III. Observable AI Operations**: ✅ PASS

- Form interactions do not involve LLM operations
- Existing LangSmith tracing and monitoring unaffected
- Performance improvements enhance user experience without changing AI operations

**IV. Type-Safe Development**: ✅ PASS

- TypeScript with strict mode for all form components
- Zod schemas for form validation and state management
- Runtime type checking at component boundaries

**V. Cost-Conscious Design**: ✅ PASS

- Form enhancements reduce user friction, potentially decreasing support costs
- No additional LLM token usage from UI improvements
- Client-side optimizations reduce server load

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:

   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

**Context7 Enhancement (if available)**:

```
For each unknown:
  Context7: mcp call resolve-library-id --libraryName="{related-tech}"
  Context7: mcp call get-library-docs --context7CompatibleLibraryID="/{tech}/docs" --topic="{unknown-domain}" --tokens=2000
For each technology:
  Context7: mcp call get-library-docs --context7CompatibleLibraryID="/{tech}/docs" --topic="best-practices" --tokens=2000
```

/plan using the response above with the given tech stack analysis and architecture.

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:

   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:

   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:

   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:

   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType copilot` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/\*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

1. **Load task template**: Use `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base structure
2. **Generate from design docs**: Extract implementation tasks from data-model.md, contracts/, and quickstart.md
3. **TDD-focused ordering**: Each component follows test-first development pattern

**Component-based task breakdown**:

- Enhanced Date Input: 6 tasks (types, hook, component, tests, integration, validation)
- Enhanced Budget Slider: 7 tasks (types, hook, component, flexible toggle, tests, integration, performance)
- Enhanced Preference Modal: 8 tasks (base modal, accommodation prefs, rental car prefs, interaction fixes, tests, integration, accessibility)
- Travel Style Progressive Disclosure: 6 tasks (types, hook, component, choice handling, tests, integration)
- Form Integration: 4 tasks (main form updates, app integration, data flow, end-to-end testing)

**Ordering Strategy**:

1. **Phase 1 - Foundation** (Parallel execution possible):

   - [P] Create enhanced component types and interfaces
   - [P] Implement custom hooks for state management
   - [P] Set up contract test framework
   - [P] Create component-specific validation schemas

2. **Phase 2 - Component Implementation** (Sequential with dependencies):

   - Enhanced Date Input component with click zone expansion
   - Enhanced Budget Slider with real-time synchronization
   - Enhanced Preference Modal base component
   - Accommodation preferences with "Other" input
   - Rental car preferences with multi-select
   - Travel Style Progressive Disclosure component

3. **Phase 3 - Integration** (Sequential):

   - Update main TripDetailsForm component
   - Integrate enhanced components into App.tsx
   - Implement form data flow and persistence
   - Add performance monitoring hooks

4. **Phase 4 - Validation** (Parallel execution possible):
   - [P] Run contract test suite
   - [P] Execute accessibility compliance tests
   - [P] Perform performance threshold validation
   - [P] End-to-end user journey testing

**Estimated Output**: 31 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md with clear dependencies and parallel execution markers

**Task Dependencies**:

- Types → Hooks → Components → Tests → Integration
- Base modal → Specific preference components
- Individual components → Form integration → E2E testing

**Constitutional Compliance Tasks**:

- Edge-runtime compatibility validation
- Bundle size monitoring and optimization
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Performance threshold verification

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
