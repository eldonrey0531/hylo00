# Feature Specification: Form UI Enhancements

**Feature Branch**: `004-form-ui-enhancements`  
**Created**: September 18, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "In Date Form Fields: departDate, returnDate - I cannot do the manual typing. and if they click in the white space inside the form the calendar should pop-up. In Budget Form - when dragging the range slider the indicator of or display won't follow the slider. For the preference modal for each inclusion the buttons can't be pressed or the fields can't be typed. On the 'Accommodations preferences' section that pops up, if they select 'Other', can we have a a text box that pops up with the prompt: Tell us more about your preferred preferences. On the 'Rental car preferences' section that pops up, can we have the 'Preferred vehicle type' be multi-select instead of single-select?. On the TRAVEL INTERESTS section, change 'Select all that apply' to 'Select all that apply to this trip'. On the BUDGET section, can we add a toggle (similar to the one on the DATES section) that says: I'm not sure or my budget is flexible. If they toggle it on, it removes the rest of what's in this section, so it just says BUDGET and the toggle with 'I'm not sure or my budget is flexible'. How can we optimize TRAVEL STYLE questions more hidden/optional. I know we already say they are optional, but it still feels overwhelming when someone is filling it out. I thought we could do something like this with 2 buttons that have different options: button 1 will be saying to answer some of the travel style forms and button 2 will be skip ahead something words If they choose button 1, the TRAVEL STYLE section appears with the 4 additional questions. If they choose option 2, the final section appears: the trip nickname form."

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → Identified multiple form enhancement categories: date input, budget slider, preference modals, travel style optimization
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → Date picker interaction improvements, budget flexibility toggle, preference modal functionality, travel style section progressive disclosure
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → Clarified accommodation prompt text to read "Tell us more about your accommodation preferences"
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → Defined scenarios for each form section enhancement
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → Each requirement addresses specific form interaction issues
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   → FormData interfaces, UI state management, preference structures
7. Run Review Checklist
   → Focused on user experience improvements without technical implementation details
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

Users filling out the travel planning form need improved interaction patterns for dates, budget settings, and preferences to reduce friction and provide more intuitive form completion.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Date Input Enhancement**

   - **Given** user is on the DATES section, **When** they click anywhere in the date input field white space, **Then** the date picker calendar opens
   - **Given** user has typed a partial date manually, **When** the input is incomplete or invalid, **Then** the form provides clear feedback without blocking input

2. **Budget Slider Synchronization**

   - **Given** user is dragging the budget range slider, **When** they move the slider handle, **Then** the budget display value updates in real-time to match the slider position
   - **Given** user has set a budget amount, **When** they enable flexible budget toggle, **Then** the budget section collapses to show only the toggle

3. **Flexible Budget Toggle**

   - **Given** user is in the BUDGET section, **When** they enable "I'm not sure or my budget is flexible" toggle, **Then** all other budget controls are hidden
   - **Given** flexible budget is enabled, **When** user disables the toggle, **Then** the full budget section with slider and controls is restored

4. **Preference Modal Interactions**

   - **Given** user opens any inclusion preference modal, **When** they try to interact with buttons or input fields, **Then** all controls function properly
   - **Given** user selects "Other" in Accommodations preferences, **When** the selection is made, **Then** a text box appears with prompt "Tell us more about your accommodation preferences"
   - **Given** user is in Rental car preferences, **When** they access "Preferred vehicle type", **Then** they can select multiple vehicle types

5. **Travel Interests Label Update**

   - **Given** user is in TRAVEL INTERESTS section, **When** they view the instruction text, **Then** it reads "Select all that apply to this trip"

6. **Travel Style Progressive Disclosure**
   - **Given** user reaches the TRAVEL STYLE section, **When** they view the options, **Then** they see two buttons: one to complete travel style questions and one to skip ahead
   - **Given** user chooses to answer travel style questions, **When** they click the first button, **Then** all four travel style subsections appear (Experience, Vibe, Sample Days, Dinner Choice)
   - **Given** user chooses to skip travel style, **When** they click the skip button, **Then** they advance directly to the trip nickname form

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user toggles flexible budget on/off repeatedly?
- How does the system handle preference modal data when switching between options?
- What happens if user partially fills travel style then decides to skip?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

#### Date Input Enhancements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow date picker activation when user clicks anywhere within the date input field area
