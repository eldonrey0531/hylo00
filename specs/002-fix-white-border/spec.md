**Created**: September 19, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Fix white border padding issues in preference components, improve header styling by removing padding and round corners, adjust content spacing, fix 'other' field placeholder behavior in accommodation preferences, and reorganize rental car and accommodation choices into 2-column 2-row grid layout"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí Identifies styling issues in preference components ‚úì
2. Extract key concepts from description

   ‚Üí Actions: Selecting preferences, entering custom text
   ‚Üí Data: Preference selections, custom input fields
   ‚Üí Constraints: Visual consistency, usability
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí All requirements are clearly specified ‚úì
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section ‚úì
5. Generate Functional Requirements ‚úì
6. Identify Key Entities ‚úì
7. Run Review Checklist ‚úì

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user planning my travel itinerary, I need to interact with clean, well-organized preference forms so that I can easily select my accommodation and rental car preferences without visual distractions or confusing interface elements.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am viewing any preference component (accommodation/rental car), **When** I look at the header area, **Then** there should be no excessive padding or visual clutter around the header elements
2. **Given** I am viewing preference options, **When** I scan the available choices, **Then** options should be organized in a clear 2x2 grid layout for easy comparison and selection
3. **Given** I click on "Other" option in accommodation preferences, **When** a text input field appears, **Then** it should have a non-editable placeholder text that guides me on what to enter
4. **Given** I am entering custom text in the "Other" field, **When** I delete all my text, **Then** the placeholder should remain visible and uneditable to maintain context
5. **Given** I am viewing the content areas below headers, **When** I look at spacing and alignment, **Then** all elements should be properly spaced without border interruptions

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user tries to edit placeholder text in "Other" field? ‚Üí System should prevent editing of placeholder text
- How does layout handle very long preference option names? ‚Üí Grid should maintain structure with appropriate text wrapping
- What if there are odd numbers of preference options? ‚Üí Layout should handle incomplete rows gracefully

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST remove excessive padding from preference component headers to eliminate white border appearance
- **FR-002**: System MUST remove rounded corners from the first content div within preference components for visual consistency
- **FR-003**: System MUST adjust padding-top for the first div after header to maintain proper spacing
- **FR-004**: System MUST adjust left and right padding for content areas below the first div to ensure proper alignment
- **FR-005**: Accommodation preferences "Other" field MUST display non-editable placeholder text when empty
- **FR-006**: System MUST prevent users from editing placeholder text in "Other" fields while allowing custom input
- **FR-007**: Rental car preference options MUST be arranged in a 2-column, 2-row grid layout (2x2)
- **FR-008**: Accommodation preference options MUST be arranged in a 2-column, 2-row grid layout (2x2)
- **FR-009**: System MUST maintain visual consistency across all preference components after styling changes
- **FR-010**: Grid layout MUST handle varying numbers of options gracefully without breaking structure

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Preference Component**: Visual container with header, content area, and interactive elements
- **Option Grid**: 2x2 layout structure for organizing selectable preference choices
- **Other Field**: Special input field with placeholder behavior for custom preferences
- **Header Section**: Top portion of preference components requiring padding/styling fixes
