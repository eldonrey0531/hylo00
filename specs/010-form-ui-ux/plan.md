# Implementation Plan: Form UI/UX Optimization & Categorization

**Branch**: `010-form-ui-ux` | **Date**: September 17, 2025 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/010-form-ui-ux/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   ✓ Feature spec loaded with clear UI/UX requirements
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   ✓ Web application type detected (React frontend + backend API)
   ✓ Clear requirements - no NEEDS CLARIFICATION items
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
   ✓ Edge-first architecture maintained (client-side form improvements)
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   ✓ No violations - form optimizations are client-side UI improvements
   ✓ Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   ✓ Current form components analyzed via workspace search
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file
   → Ready for execution
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → Will validate post-design compliance
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
   → Ready for planning
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands.

## Summary

Form UI/UX optimization focusing on three critical areas: 1) Flexible dates toggle should hide "Depart/Return" labels and show contextual messaging, 2) Budget slider needs visual indicators for total vs per-person mode and real-time amount updates, and 3) Reorganize form components into logical "Trip Details" and "Travel Style" categories for better user experience and maintainability.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.x
**Primary Dependencies**: React 18, LangChain.js, Vite, Vercel Edge Runtime
**Storage**: Client-side state management (React hooks)
**Testing**: Vitest, Playwright for form interactions
**Platform**: Vercel (client-side deployment)
**Target Platform**: Modern browsers with React support
**Project Type**: Web application - React frontend with edge functions backend
**Performance Goals**: Real-time UI updates (<50ms for slider interactions)
**Constraints**: Maintain existing form validation, preserve accessibility standards
**Scale/Scope**: 10+ form components across 2 categorized sections

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

### ✅ Edge-First Architecture

- **Compliance**: Form optimizations are client-side React component improvements
- **No API Changes**: Budget slider and date label improvements use existing state management
- **Edge Function Compatibility**: Form categorization maintains current submission flow to edge functions

### ✅ Multi-LLM Resilience

- **Compliance**: UI improvements don't affect LLM routing infrastructure
- **No Changes**: Form submission to multi-agent system remains unchanged

### ✅ Observable AI Operations

- **Compliance**: Form UX improvements don't impact LangSmith tracing
- **Maintained**: Existing form submission logging preserved

### ✅ Type-Safe Development

- **Enhancement**: Improved TypeScript interfaces for form categorization
- **Validation**: Zod schemas remain intact for form data validation

### ✅ Progressive Enhancement

- **Improvement**: Better user experience with clearer visual feedback
- **Graceful Degradation**: Form functionality preserved if JS disabled

### ✅ Cost-Conscious Design

- **Compliance**: Client-side optimizations don't affect LLM provider costs
- **No Impact**: Form improvements don't change API usage patterns

### ✅ Security by Default

- **Maintained**: No changes to form data validation or submission security
- **Preservation**: Existing input sanitization patterns preserved

**Structure Decision**: [DEFAULT to Option 1 unless Technical Context indicates web/mobile app]

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:

   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

```

For each unknown in Technical Context:
Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
For each technology choice:
Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"

```

**Context7 Enhancement (if available)**:

```

For each unknown:
Context7: mcp call resolve-library-id --libraryName="{related-tech}"
Context7: mcp call get-library-docs --context7CompatibleLibraryID="/{tech}/docs" --topic="{unknown-domain}" --tokens=2000
For each technology:
Context7: mcp call get-library-docs --context7CompatibleLibraryID="/{tech}/docs" --topic="best-practices" --tokens=2000

```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
- Decision: [what was chosen]
- Rationale: [why chosen]
- Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]
- Context7 Documentation: [if used, append outputs]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

**@workspace Integration for Implementation Planning**:
During planning, use @workspace to understand existing patterns:

- `@workspace current project architecture in src/ and api/`
- `@workspace similar feature implementations`
- `@workspace constitutional compliance patterns`
- `@workspace error handling implementations`

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:

- Entity name, fields, relationships
- Validation rules from requirements
- State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:

- For each user action → endpoint
- Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
- Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:

- One test file per endpoint
- Assert request/response schemas
- Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:

- Each story → integration test scenario
- Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
- Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh copilot` for your AI assistant
- If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
- Preserve manual additions between markers
- Update recent changes (keep last 3)
- Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
- Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/\*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:

- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
