# Feature Specification: Form UI/UX Optimization & Categorization

**Feature Branch**: `010-form-ui-ux`  
**Created**: September 17, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Form UI/UX optimization: Fix flexible dates slider display, budget slider functionality, and reorganize form categorization for better user experience and maintainability"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚úì Clear UI/UX improvements identified: flexible dates, budget slider, form categorization
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚úì Identified: date flexibility UI, budget slider functionality, form reorganization
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí No major ambiguities - requirements are clear from user feedback
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚úì Clear user flows for date selection and budget setting
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚úì Each requirement is testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   ‚úì Form structure and state management entities identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚úì No implementation details, focused on user experience
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a traveler planning a trip, I want intuitive and responsive form controls that clearly indicate my selections and preferences, so that I can efficiently input my travel requirements without confusion about what options I've selected or what the interface is showing me.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I'm on the dates section with flexible dates toggle off, **When** I toggle "I'm not sure or my dates are flexible" to on, **Then** the "Depart" and "Return" labels should be hidden or replaced with more appropriate messaging since specific dates are no longer relevant
2. **Given** I'm on the budget section, **When** I toggle between "Total trip budget" and "Per-person budget", **Then** there should be a clear visual indicator above or near the money amount showing which mode is currently active
3. **Given** I'm using the budget slider, **When** I move the slider, **Then** the displayed money amount should move/update in real-time to reflect the slider position
4. **Given** I'm completing the travel planning form, **When** I navigate through sections, **Then** the form should be logically categorized into "Trip Details" and "Travel Style" groupings for clarity

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user toggles flexible dates multiple times quickly?
- How does the budget indicator behave during rapid slider movements?
- What happens if user tries to access reorganized form sections via direct navigation?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

**Flexible Dates UI Improvements:**

- **FR-001**: System MUST hide or replace "Depart" and "Return" labels when flexible dates toggle is activated
- **FR-002**: System MUST provide contextually appropriate messaging when dates are flexible (e.g., "Trip Duration" instead of specific date labels)
- **FR-003**: System MUST maintain clear visual hierarchy when switching between fixed and flexible date modes

**Budget Slider Enhancements:**

- **FR-004**: System MUST display a clear visual indicator showing whether "Total trip budget" or "Per-person budget" mode is active
- **FR-005**: System MUST ensure budget amount updates in real-time as user moves the slider
- **FR-006**: System MUST maintain slider-to-display synchronization across all budget interactions

**Form Categorization & Organization:**

- **FR-007**: System MUST reorganize form sections into logical groupings: "Trip Details" and "Travel Style"
- **FR-008**: Trip Details category MUST include: Location, Dates, Travelers, Budget
- **FR-009**: Travel Style category MUST include: Travel Group, Travel Interests (with modal preferences), Travel Experience, Trip Vibe, Sample Days, Dinner Choices, Trip Nickname
- **FR-010**: System MUST maintain existing functionality while implementing new categorization structure
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide clear visual separation between Trip Details and Travel Style sections

**User Experience Consistency:**

- **FR-012**: System MUST ensure all form interactions provide immediate visual feedback
- **FR-013**: System MUST maintain accessibility standards across all UI improvements
- **FR-014**: System MUST preserve existing form validation and error handling behaviors

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Form Section Category**: Represents logical groupings (Trip Details, Travel Style) with associated form components
- **Date Selection State**: Manages flexible vs. fixed date modes and appropriate UI display states
- **Budget Display State**: Tracks active budget mode (total vs. per-person) and slider synchronization
- **Form Navigation State**: Handles section transitions and maintains user progress across categorized sections
