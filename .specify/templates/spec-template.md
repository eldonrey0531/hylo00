# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints, validation needs
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Validation section
   ‚Üí Focus on behavior validation rather than test creation
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be implementable and validatable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚úÖ Include validation criteria for implementation
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders and developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Focus on validation**: Describe how to verify the feature works, not how to test it
3. **Think like a developer**: Requirements should be specific enough to implement without guessing
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data validation rules
   - Performance expectations
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Success criteria for implementation

## User Scenarios & Validation _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

[Describe the main user journey in plain language]

### Implementation Validation Scenarios

1. **When** [action is performed], **Verify** [expected outcome is achieved]
2. **When** [condition exists], **Verify** [system behaves as expected]

### Edge Cases

- How should system behave when [unusual input] is provided?
- What should happen when [resource limitation] occurs?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability] with validation: [how to verify]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability] with validation: [how to verify]
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction] with validation: [how to verify]

_Example of marking unclear requirements:_

- **FR-004**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-005**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Implementation Constraints _(include if specific constraints exist)_

- Must integrate with [existing system] without breaking changes
- Must comply with [specific regulation or standard]
- Must maintain backward compatibility with [existing feature]

### Performance Expectations _(include if relevant)_

- Should handle [number] concurrent users with [response time]
- Should process [amount] of data within [time constraint]

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Implementation Notes

_This section is added during the planning phase, not in the initial spec_

**Technical Approach**: [Added during /plan phase based on research]
**Key Decisions**: [Added during /plan phase based on technical constraints]
**Validation Strategy**: [Added during /plan phase describing how to verify implementation]
